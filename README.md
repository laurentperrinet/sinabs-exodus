sinabs-slayer
=============

A slayer fork


Installation
------------

This is a `namespace package` meaning that once installed this will be sharing its namespace with `sinabs` package.
In order to install it correctly, you must use `pip`.

```
$ pip install . 
```


> I have not managed to get the import to work properly while running
`python setup.py install` so far. So I recommend that you use pip while installing the package.
